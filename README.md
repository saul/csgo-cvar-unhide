# cvar-unhide

This Source Engine plugin reveals all console variables (convars/cvars) that are marked as hidden or development-only. The plugin can also set console variables to arbitrary values, bypassing any hard-coded minimum/maximum. Furthermore, console commands can be 'force dispatched' regardless of whether they are marked as hidden, cheat or development-only.

A list of all console variables/commands that are made available by this plugin can be found in [cvarlist-csgo.md](./cvarlist-csgo.md) and [cvarlist-portal2.md](./cvarlist-portal2.md).

ðŸ’¡ For VAC safety, you must add `-insecure` to the launch options. The plugin will not load without this command-line argument set.

### Supported games

- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
- Portal 2

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the plugin from GitHub: https://github.com/saul/cvar-unhide/releases/latest
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP to the game's mod folder. \
   ðŸ‘‰ Create the folder if it doesn't already exist.
